# Track the Visited URLs  
This is a Linked List based project that is centered on an effecient browser history tracking system.  
Here, we have given 5 different approaches to solve the problem. Although, the one, that was most optimal as per our arguments, was finally implemented.  

## Description
We have prepared a proper documentation for all the **five** different possible approaches. Along with that, We have kept the code of our finally implemented solution open to all, as well. Feel free to make PRs and contribute with us!  

A report on the whole project is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkxqgkJH-GTyc8buBk0kClkiQlLsn0Sg6HERp9_1B8A/edit?usp=sharing).
